This repository provides the implementation for the paper:  
**"Learning Priors of Human Motion With Vision Transformers"**  
Published in *COMPSAC 2024*. DOI: [10.1109/COMPSAC61105.2024.00060](https://doi.org/10.1109/COMPSAC61105.2024.00060)

## Overview

The paper introduces a novel neural architecture based on Vision Transformers (ViTs) to learn priors of human motion. This method offers a powerful solution for predicting typical human trajectories and behaviors in various settings. Applications include:
- Urban mobility analysis
- Robot navigation
- Crowd behavior modeling

### Features
- Vision Transformer-based motion analysis
- Supports generalization to diverse environments
- Python implementation with sample datasets

## Installation

Clone this repository and install the necessary Python dependencies using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pla10/IRI_Barcelona.git
cd IRI_Barcelona
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
- Prepare Dataset: Provide motion trajectory datasets in the expected format.
- Train Model: Use the provided training scripts to train the Vision Transformer.
- Evaluation: Evaluate the model's predictions using the included test scripts.
